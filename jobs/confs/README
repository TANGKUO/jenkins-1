This directory contains all the files needed to generate the jobs for the
jenkins-ovirt.org jenkins instance.

It's organized in directories, being the first level to separate between complete
yaml files and other files to be included inside the jobs.

The complete yaml files are inside the 'yaml' directory, and for each type of
files to be included (shell-scripts, groovy-scripts, yaml-scripts, ...) there
should be a directory with their name on that same level.

Inside the yaml dir, there will be another level separating theyamls by type,
and one dir for the jobs, job-templates and projects themselves (all that is
very likely to change to adapt the current needs)

An example of a possible layout:

./
 |-yaml
 | |-builders
 | | |-rpm_mock_builder.yaml
 | | \-default_rpm_builder.yaml
 | |-jobs
 | | \-mycustomjob.yaml
 | ...
 |-shell-scripts
 |  |-cleanup_vdsm.sh
 |  |-build_rpm.sh
 |  ...
 |-groovy-scripts
 |  |-check_vdsm_functional_tests.groovy
 |   ...
 ...

NOTE: You need a patched version of the jenkins-job-builder project, with the
recursive patch[1], the parallel patch[2] and the include files patch[3].

A better way of getting that modified version will be provided soon.

Make sure you are at this same level when running jenkins-job builder or that you
have this directory in the include patch for the scripts (see [1] for more info).
To test:
> jenkins-jobs --debug test --recursive -o /tmp/outdir yaml

To run:
> jenkins-jobs --threads 0 --debug --conf path/to/my/config update --recursive yaml
