      # We're not using the publish-rpms-nightly-publishers macro here because
      # code here is different (has the new 'sync from tested' functionality).
      # We expect the syncing from tested will simplify the publisher jobs over
      # time to the point where they all can use the same simple job template as
      # opposed to separate YAML per job.
      # The publishers macros support and are needed just the older style
      # publisher jobs for the time being
